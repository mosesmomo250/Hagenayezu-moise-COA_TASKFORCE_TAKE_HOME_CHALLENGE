COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenge

This repository showcases my solution for the COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenge. The challenge involved creating an interactive photo gallery and addressing two coding challenges using JavaScript.

Navigate to the project directory by entering "cd interactive-photo-gallery" in your command line interface. Next, open the "index.html" file in your web browser to view the interactive photo gallery. You can also open the "index.js" file to explore the interactive gallery's underlying structure and functionality.

CSS Styling:
I have utilized CSS for styling the gallery features, ensuring an exact match with the Figma designs down to the pixel. Additionally, I have implemented media queries to guarantee responsiveness across various screen sizes and devices. This approach ensures that the interactive photo gallery maintains its  functionality regardless of the user's device or viewport size.

For setting up the Coding Challenges, begin by navigating to the Challenges directory using the command "cd Challenges" in my terminal. Once there, open the "arrayMap.js" and "stringTransform.js" files in my preferred code editor to examine the solutions.

For the Array Manipulation challenge (arrayMap.js), I devised a function to ascertain the presence of a contiguous subarray within an array that sums up to the target value. The solution is closely to the given problem statement and constraints, ensuring the anticipated time and space complexities are met.

Regarding the String Transformation challenge (stringTransform.js), I crafted a function to alter a string based on the specified rules. The solution adeptly handles all potential scenarios outlined in the problem statement, while also achieving the anticipated time and space complexity requirements.
